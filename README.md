# Web Development 2 Project

This project is built using Node.JS, Express and Mongoose.
To run it for development, you need to do 4 things:

1. `npm update --save-dev` to install all dependencies and devDependencies
2. create a `.env` file for your environment variables using `.env.example` as a boilerplate
3. `npm run dev` (thanks to `nodemon` this automatically restarts the server on code changes)
4. Have fun!
